At least 85 percent (85%) of the area's total population must reside within the units that are “distressed,” i.e., that meet one of the applicable economic distress criteria above, as reported by the decennial Census (Unemployment, Poverty and MFI for census tracts plus, for counties only, Population Loss and Migration Loss); the balance of the area's population may reside in the non-“distressed” tract(s).
